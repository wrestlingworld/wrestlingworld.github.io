<p>The tag team match is a very common type of match used all over the world. In this match, there are teams of wrestlers going against each other. While the number of wrestlers on each team may vary greatly, most tag team matches have teams of two.</p>

	<p>One member of each team wrestles while the other team member must wait in their team’s designated corner. The teams’ corners are always place directly across from each other, and team members in the match are able to tag in their partner to wrestle in their place. Any team member who has not been legally tagged in is not allowed in the ring, and once a legal tag member tags their partner in, they have until the referee counts to 5 to leave the ring.</p>

	<p> Almost every wrestling organization, big or small, have a championship for tag teams. Some of the most popular tag teams include Edge and Christian, The Young Buck, The Wolves, and Hardy Boyz. </p>
