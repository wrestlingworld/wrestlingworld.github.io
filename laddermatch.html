<p>The ladder match is a unique kind of match. Unlike most other kinds of matches, you cannot win by simply pinning your opponent and you cannot be disqualified. In a ladder match, there is an item hanging above the wrestling ring, suspended on a cable connected to the roof. Depending on the preset ruling of the match, this may be anything championship title or a contract to a weapon. To win the match, a wrestler must retrieve the item hanging above. And how will they do this? By using a ladder.</p>

	<p>The rule may seem simple, but there is more to the match. The prize is about 25-30 feet above the ring, and not all of the ladders are tall enough to reach it. Along with this, the wrestlers in the ring will not take lightly to having their opponent simply raise a ladder to win. A typical ladder match starts with the wrestlers trying to injure their opponent before attempting to climb a ladder. </p>

	<p> Because there is no disqualification in a ladder match, ladders can be used as a weapon. While many ladder matches are one-on-one, larger matches can include up to 10 participants. In matches like these, its common to see even more creative uses for the ladder as a weapon.  </p>
<p> Many wrestlers are known for having great showings in ladder matches. Wrestlers like Jeff Hardy, Chris Jericho, and Edge are famous for putting on very good ladder matches. </p>
