<p>The table match is one of the most suspenseful match types in wrestling. There are no pins, submissions or disqualifications in this match. The only way to win is to put the other wrestler through a table.</p>

	<p>Due to the nature of this kind of match, almost all tables matches are one-on-one. Many of these matches involve the wrestlers trying to knock their opponent off balance or overpowering them to put them through a table.  Many wrestlers try to make the match last longer than usual, making their opponent too tired to recover.</p>

	<p> Tables matches do not happen often but are a great match to watch. Some wrestlers known for their tables matches are the team The Dudley Boys, and Tommy Dreamer.</p>
